** DESCRIPTION **     : In this task, I worked on performing Sentiment Analysis, which is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to understand emotions and opinions from written text. The goal of this task was to analyze how people feel about financial topics by studying large amounts of text data, such as tweets, news headlines, or reviews related to finance, banks, or stock markets.

To complete this task, I first collected a dataset containing text data related to financial products and services. For example, I used tweets that mentioned topics like credit cards, fraud, banking services, and investment advice. These texts often include public opinions, concerns, satisfaction, or dissatisfaction, which makes them a good source to study sentiment.

After gathering the data, I cleaned it to remove unnecessary characters like special symbols, URLs, punctuation, and stop words (common words that don’t carry much meaning like “the,” “is,” “at,” etc.). This step was important to make the data easier to process by the machine learning model.

Once the data was cleaned, I used a sentiment analysis model to classify each text as positive, negative, or neutral. I used a simple approach at first, applying a pre-trained model from the TextBlob library. Later, I also tried using VADER, which is specifically built for analyzing social media text and short sentences.

The results were quite insightful. I could see patterns such as more negative sentiment around topics like fraud or loan rejection, while positive sentiments appeared more often in tweets about cashback offers or good customer service experiences. I summarized this information in a chart to visualize how public sentiment varies across different financial themes.

This kind of analysis is extremely useful in real-world finance. Companies use sentiment analysis to monitor customer feedback, detect negative trends early, and improve their services. For example, if a bank sees that thousands of customers are expressing frustration online about a new app update, it can quickly act to resolve the issue.

Throughout the task, I learned how to apply basic NLP tools, handle real-world messy text data, and interpret the output of sentiment classification models. More importantly, I understood how this technical skill directly connects to business goals, especially in financial industries where customer trust and reputation matter a lot.

In conclusion, this task helped me gain practical knowledge of how to work with text data, understand public opinion using machine learning, and convert raw feedback into meaningful insights. In future projects, I plan to go deeper by using more advanced models like BERT or fine-tuning sentiment analysis for specific financial topics, such as credit card fraud detection or investment product reviews.
